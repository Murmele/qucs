These are qucs plugins -- stuff that is optional and does not hard depend on
other plugins.

Each plugin is compiled from the files contained in a single directory and
listed in the MakeList file. The plugin name corresponds to the directory
name, and will be installed to ${pkglibdir}/plugins/

For example, a plugin that relates to my_stuff, will be compiled from files in
plugins/my_stuff/ and its name will be plugins/my_stuff.so. It will be
installed such that qucs will be able to "load plugins/my_stuff", e.g. by
invoking qucs with the -a plugins/my_stuff option.

MakeList files contain lists of files that relate to a plugin. Currently,
these are read by standard build systems (autotools, cmake) that build the
package. Future Qucs will be able to directly load a plugin from source code
or compile/load a directory containing a MakeList.
