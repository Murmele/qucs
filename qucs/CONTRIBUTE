Qucs 0.1.* is welcoming contributions.

Currently, the code is in flux in many places while modularising, and porting
to Qt5. This makes it more difficult to contribute, and contributions should
focus on fixing bugs and porting the features present in 0.0.20 (cf. ROADMAP).

Code contributions that are clearly separate from the existing code base will
be accepted given that they look useful. Examples for this are plugins.
